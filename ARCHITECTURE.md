# Architecture

A developer reference for how the pieces fit together: the data model, the REST API, and the Socket.io event protocol that drives the game in real time. If you're setting up or hosting a game, see [README.md](README.md) and [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) instead — this doc is for anyone changing or extending the code.

## Overview

There is one backend process (Express + Socket.io) and one frontend build (React SPA). Boards are edited and games are administered over plain REST; everything that happens *during* a live game — buzzing in, scoring, Daily Double wagers, Final Jeopardy — happens over Socket.io, because every connected client (host, board/TV, each player's phone) needs to see state changes the instant they happen.

```
frontend/src/pages/*        REST calls (boards, media)  ──►  backend/src/routes/*
frontend/src/socket.ts      Socket.io client            ──►  backend/src/socket/*
```

Game sessions are **in-memory only** (`backend/src/socket/gameManager.ts`), keyed by room code — restarting the server ends all live games. Boards, by contrast, are persisted to disk as JSON (`backend/src/storage/boardStorage.ts`), so editor content survives restarts.

---

## Data Model

Canonical types live in `backend/src/types.ts` (frontend has a mirrored copy in `frontend/src/types.ts`).

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Board` | A saved board: a list of `rounds`, optional Final Jeopardy config. Persisted to disk. |
| `Round` | One grid: `{ id, name?, categories, pointValues }`. A board plays through `rounds` in order (Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, ...). |
| `Category` / `Question` | A round's grid content. A `Question` may be flagged `isDailyDouble`. Question ids are UUIDs, unique across the whole board (not just within a round) — this is what lets `answeredQuestions` stay a single flat list while still being able to tell whether a *specific round* is complete. |
| `GameState` | The full state of one live session: players, buzzer state (incl. lockouts), active question, `currentRoundIndex`, Daily Double sub-state, Final Jeopardy public sub-state, `phase`. Broadcast wholesale to every client on every change via `game:state`. |
| `Player` | `{ id, name, score, color, stats? }`. `stats` (`correct`/`wrong`/`buzzes`/`earlyBuzzes`) is populated lazily on first use. |
| `DailyDoubleState` | Sub-state while a Daily Double wager is being collected (see [Daily Double](#daily-double)). |
| `FinalPublicState` | The *public* Final Jeopardy state broadcast to all clients. Wagers and answers are hidden here until revealed — see [Final Jeopardy](#final-jeopardy). |

`GameState` is intentionally broadcast in full rather than diffed — sessions are small (a handful of players), so simplicity wins over bandwidth.

### Legacy board migration

Boards saved before multi-round support (a single top-level `categories`/`pointValues` instead of `rounds`) are transparently normalized into a one-round `Board` by `boardStorage.normalizeBoard()` on every read (`getBoard`, `listBoards`, `createBoard`, `updateBoard`), and rewritten in the new shape the next time they're saved. There is no separate migration step or script to run.

### Secrets are kept out of `GameState`

Two things are deliberately **not** in the broadcast `GameState`, to avoid leaking answers or wagers to players before a reveal:

- **Final Jeopardy wagers/answers/drafts** live server-side in a private `Map` inside `backend/src/socket/finalJeopardy.ts` (the `secrets` map), pushed to the host panel only via a separate `fj:host-state` event.
- **The Final Jeopardy countdown timer** (`NodeJS.Timeout`) can't be serialized over Socket.io anyway, so it also lives in that private map.

---

## Storage Layout

```
$DATA_DIR/
├── boards/
│   └── <board-id>.json     # one file per board, see Board type above
└── media/
    └── <uuid>.<ext>        # uploaded images/video, served at /media/<filename>
```

`DATA_DIR` defaults to `./data` and is overridden via the `DATA_DIR` env var (see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md#environment-variables)). There is no database — `boardStorage.ts` reads/writes these JSON files directly, and `listBoards()` parses every file's metadata on each call (fine at the scale of a handful of local boards).

---

## REST API

Base path: `/api`. All bodies are JSON.

### Boards — `backend/src/routes/boards.ts`

| Method | Path | Body | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/boards` | — | `{ id, name, roundCount, hasFinal, createdAt, updatedAt }[]` | List view for the Dashboard — summary only, not the full round content. |
| `GET` | `/api/boards/:id` | — | `Board` | 404 if not found. Legacy files are normalized to `rounds[]` on the way out (see [Legacy board migration](#legacy-board-migration)). |
| `POST` | `/api/boards` | `Partial<Board>` (accepts either `rounds` or legacy `categories`/`pointValues`) | `201` + `Board` | Missing fields get defaults (one empty round, `[200,400,600,800,1000]` point values). |
| `PUT` | `/api/boards/:id` | `Partial<Board>` | `Board` | Shallow-merges onto the existing (normalized) board; 404 if not found. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/boards/:id` | — | `204` | 404 if not found. |

### Media — `backend/src/routes/media.ts`

| Method | Path | Body | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/media/upload` | `multipart/form-data`, field `file` | `{ filename, url, mediaType }` | Accepts JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP and MP4/WebM/Ogg, 200 MB max. `url` is a relative path (`/media/<filename>`) served statically. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/media/:filename` | — | `204` | Filename is sanitized with `path.basename` to prevent path traversal. |

### Health

| Method | Path | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | `{ status: 'ok', timestamp }` |

In production, any other route falls through to the built React app (`frontend`'s build output) for client-side routing.

## Real-Time Protocol (Socket.io)

### Rooms

Every socket that's part of a game joins the room named by the **room code** (e.g. `ABC123`). Two extra rooms scope host-only broadcasts:

| Room | Who's in it | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `<roomCode>` | Everyone in the game (host, board, all players) | `game:state` and other game-wide broadcasts |
| `host:<roomCode>` | The host's own socket | Reserved for host-only events (currently unused directly, kept for future host-specific messages) |
| `hostpanel:<roomCode>` | The host's own socket | Final Jeopardy's private `fj:host-state` / `fj:host-log` events — never sent to players' phones |

### Core Game Events — `backend/src/socket/socketHandler.ts`

Convention: `host:*` and `player:*` (and bare verbs like `buzz`) are **client → server**; everything else is **server → client** unless noted. Most host actions simply mutate `gameManager` state and then re-broadcast `game:state` to the whole room — that pattern isn't repeated per row below.

| Event | Direction | Payload | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `host:create` | → server | `{ boardId }` | Creates a session, generates a room code, joins host to `<room>`, `host:<room>`, `hostpanel:<room>`. Replies `host:created` with `{ roomCode, state }`. |
| `host:join` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Rejoin as host after a refresh. Replies with `game:state`, or `error` if the room's gone. |
| `player:join` | → server | `{ roomCode, name, color }` | Adds a new player. Replies `player:joined` to the caller, then `game:state` to the room. |
| `host:add-player` | → server | `{ roomCode, name, color }` | Host adds a player who has no phone of their own (see [Daily Double](#daily-double) for why this matters). |
| `player:rejoin` | → server | `{ roomCode, playerId }` | Reconnect flow (e.g. phone screen locked) — re-associates the socket with an existing player id without creating a new player. |
| `buzz` | → server | — | Records a buzz for the calling socket's player. Rate-limited server-side to ~10 presses/sec per socket. Outcome depends on state — see [Buzzer](#buzzer) below. `won` broadcasts `buzz:winner` + `game:state`; `early`/`locked-out` reply `buzz:locked-out` to the caller (and push a stats-only `game:state` to the host panel); `ignored` replies `buzz:too-late`. |
| `host:enable-buzzer` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Opens the buzzer. Broadcasts `buzzer:open`. |
| `host:reset-buzzer` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Re-opens the buzzer after a wrong answer, clearing the previous winner. Broadcasts `buzzer:open`. |
| `host:lock-buzzer` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Closes the buzzer without a winner selected. Broadcasts `buzzer:locked`. |
| `host:set-lockout` | → server | `{ roomCode, ms }` | Sets the early-buzz lockout duration (`0`, `250`, `500`, or `1000`); invalid values are ignored. |
| `host:open-question` | → server | `{ roomCode, questionId, isDailyDouble, boardHighValue? }` | Sets the active question and clears any buzz lockouts left over from the previous one. If `isDailyDouble`, also kicks off the Daily Double wager flow (see below). |
| `host:dd-pick-player` | → server | `{ roomCode, playerId }` | Manual contestant pick when no player has a tracked "last correct" (see [Daily Double](#daily-double)). |
| `host:dd-override-wager` | → server (ack) | `{ roomCode, amount }` | Host sets/corrects the Daily Double wager. Ack: `{ ok, error? }`. |
| `dd:wager` | → server (ack) | `{ amount }` | Player submits their own Daily Double wager. Ack: `{ ok, error? }`. |
| `host:reveal-dd` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Reveals the Daily Double clue after the wager is locked and the splash has played. |
| `host:show-response` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Reveals the answer on the board view. |
| `host:close-question` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Marks the active question answered and clears per-question state. If this closed the last clue of the last round and the board has no Final Jeopardy, also ends the game (see [Phase / end-game](#phase--end-game)). |
| `host:score` | → server | `{ roomCode, playerId, delta, outcome?, isDailyDouble? }` | Applies a score delta. If `outcome` is given, also updates that player's stats and, for a non-Daily-Double correct answer, records them as `lastCorrectPlayerId` (who gets offered the next Daily Double). Broadcasts `score:result`. |
| `host:set-score` | → server | `{ roomCode, playerId, score }` | Absolute score override (manual correction). |
| `host:remove-player` | → server | `{ roomCode, playerId }` | Removes a player from the session. |
| `host:start` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Moves `phase` from `lobby` to `playing`. |
| `host:next-round` | → server (ack) | `{ roomCode }` | Advances `currentRoundIndex`, carrying players/scores/stats/`lastCorrectPlayerId` forward and clearing per-question/buzzer/lockout state. Rejects (ack `{ ok: false, error }`) if a question/Daily-Double/Final-Jeopardy is active, or this is already the last round. Broadcasts `round:changed` then `game:state`. |
| `host:end-game` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Sets `phase` to `finished` (see [Phase / end-game](#phase--end-game)), tearing down any in-progress Final Jeopardy secrets. Valid at any point, including mid-Final-Jeopardy. |
| `host:resume-game` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Moves `phase` back to `playing` — undoes an accidental `host:end-game`. |
| `host:end` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Broadcasts `game:ended`, tears down Final Jeopardy secrets, deletes the session entirely. Irreversible — this is "Close Room" in the host UI, distinct from `host:end-game`. |
| `get:state` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Any client can request a state resync; replies `game:state` to the caller only. |
| `game:state` | ← server | `GameState` | The full session state. Sent after nearly every mutation — this is the one event every client type listens to. |
| `buzz:winner` | ← server | `{ playerId, playerName, timestamp }` | Broadcast the moment someone wins the buzz. |
| `buzz:too-late` | ← server | — | Sent to a socket whose buzz was `ignored` (no active question, or the game has ended). |
| `buzz:locked-out` | ← server | `{ until }` | Sent to a socket whose buzz was early or still inside its lockout window. `until` is the epoch ms the lockout clears. |
| `round:changed` | ← server | `{ index, name }` | Broadcast after `host:next-round` succeeds; drives the board view's round splash. |
| `buzzer:open` / `buzzer:locked` | ← server | — | Convenience events for sound effects / UI, alongside the `game:state` that carries the same info. |
| `score:result` | ← server | `{ playerId, correct }` | Drives the correct/wrong sound effect. |
| `game:ended` | ← server | — | Tells all clients the host closed the room (`host:end`) — distinct from the game merely being `finished`, which clients read off `game:state.phase` instead. |
| `error` | ← server | `{ message }` | Generic error reply (bad room code, etc.) for events without an ack callback. |
| `disconnect` | (socket.io built-in) | — | Un-tracks the socket from `socketPlayers` but does **not** remove the player from the game, so a phone can reconnect (via `player:rejoin`) without losing its score. |

### Final Jeopardy Events — `backend/src/socket/finalJeopardy.ts`

All host-triggered events below broadcast the updated `FinalPublicState` via the room's regular `game:state` (it's nested at `GameState.finalJeopardy`), plus an `fj:host-log` breadcrumb to the host panel. Player-submitted events use an ack callback instead of a broadcast-only reply.

| Event | Direction | Payload | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `host:fj-start` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Validates the board has Final Jeopardy configured, snapshots the reveal order (ascending score), auto-locks a $0 wager for any player already at $0, sets stage to `intro`. |
| `host:fj-reveal-category` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | `intro` → `wagering`; reveals the category to all clients. |
| `host:fj-reveal-clue` | → server | `{ roomCode, force? }` | `wagering` → `clue`. Refuses unless every contestant has wagered, unless `force: true` (then missing wagers default to $0). |
| `host:fj-start-timer` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | `clue` → `answering`; sets `deadline` (server timestamp) using the board's `timerSeconds` (default 30s) and schedules an automatic `lockAnswers` ~750ms after it elapses. |
| `host:fj-begin-reveal` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | `locked` → `reveal`, starting at the first (lowest-score) contestant. |
| `host:fj-reveal-step` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Advances `revealStep`: `name` → `wager` → `answer`. (`answer` → `judged` happens via `host:fj-judge`, not this event.) |
| `host:fj-judge` | → server | `{ roomCode, playerId, correct }` | Applies (or re-applies, idempotently) the score delta for the currently-revealed contestant, records their stats, sets `revealStep: 'judged'`. |
| `host:fj-undo` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Reverts the last judgment's score delta and stats, moves `revealStep` back to `answer`. Only valid immediately after a judge. |
| `host:fj-next` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Advances to the next contestant in reveal order (`revealStep` resets to `name`). No-op on the last contestant — the host proceeds via `host:fj-show-response` instead. |
| `host:fj-show-response` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Reveals the correct response text. |
| `host:fj-scoreboard` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Final stage: shows the podium/stats scoreboard. |
| `host:fj-exit` | → server | `{ roomCode }` | Clears Final Jeopardy secrets and public state (e.g. after the game ends). |
| `host:fj-set-for-player` | → server | `{ roomCode, playerId, wager?, answer? }` | Host enters a wager and/or answer on behalf of a player with no phone. |
| `fj:wager` | → server (ack) | `{ amount }` | Player submits their wager during `wagering`. Validated against `0 ≤ amount ≤ maxWager` and integer-only. |
| `fj:draft` | → server (ack) | `{ text }` | Live-syncs the player's in-progress answer to the host panel (`fj:host-state`) without locking it in. |
| `fj:answer` | → server (ack) | `{ text }` | Locks in the player's final answer. |
| `fj:host-state` | ← server | `{ wagers, answers, drafts }` (keyed by `playerId`) | **Host panel only** (`hostpanel:<room>`). The one place secret wager/answer/draft data is ever sent over the wire. |
| `fj:host-log` | ← server | `{ msg, ts }` | **Host panel only.** Human-readable breadcrumb trail of Final Jeopardy actions, shown in the host's log. |

## State Machines

### Buzzer

```
idle ──host:enable-buzzer──► open ──buzz (first in, not locked out)──► locked ──host:close-question──► idle
                               │                                                          ▲
                               └───────────────────host:reset-buzzer─────────────────────┘
```

`gameManager.recordBuzz` checks and flips state in one synchronous step, so ties are impossible. It returns one of four outcomes, checked in this order:

1. **`ignored`** — no active question, or the game has ended (`phase === 'finished'`). No penalty; this is what makes buzzing between clues harmless.
2. **`early`** — the buzzer is `idle` or `locked` (i.e. not yet open) and a question is active. If `settings.lockoutMs > 0`, sets `buzzLockouts[playerId] = now + lockoutMs` (re-arming any existing lockout) and increments `stats.earlyBuzzes`.
3. **`locked-out`** — the buzzer is `open`, but this player is still inside a lockout window from an earlier early press. Doesn't re-arm further.
4. **`won`** — the buzzer is `open` and this player isn't locked out. Flips `buzzerState` to `locked`, as before.

`buzzLockouts` is keyed by `playerId` (not socket id), so a lockout survives a reconnect. It's cleared only in `openQuestion` and `closeQuestion` — `enableBuzzer`/`resetBuzzer` deliberately leave it alone, since a press in the final `lockoutMs` before the buzzer opens still has to count as early.

The lockout duration lives in `GameState.settings.lockoutMs` (default `250`, one of `0/250/500/1000`), set via `host:set-lockout` and changeable mid-game.

### Daily Double

```
(no lastCorrectPlayerId) ──► picking ──host:dd-pick-player──► wagering ──► ready
        │
(has lastCorrectPlayerId) ──────────────────────────────────► wagering ──► ready
```

- `wagering → ready` happens via `dd:wager` (player, if they have a device) or `host:dd-override-wager` (host).
- The host's override field is normally disabled until the assigned player has submitted their own wager — the one exception is a player added via `host:add-player` (`hasDevice: false`), whose *only* path to a wager is the host override.
- `maxWager` is `max(player's current score, board's highest point value)`, floored at $0, per standard Jeopardy rules.

### Final Jeopardy (`FinalStage`)

```
intro ──reveal-category──► wagering ──reveal-clue──► clue ──start-timer──► answering
                                                                                │
                                                                    (timer expires / all answered)
                                                                                ▼
final ◄──scoreboard── response ◄──show-response── reveal ◄──begin-reveal── locked
```

Within `reveal`, each contestant (lowest score first) steps through `revealStep`: `name → wager → answer → judged`, with `host:fj-undo` allowed to rewind `judged → answer` before `host:fj-next` moves to the following contestant.

### Rounds

```
round 0 ──host:next-round──► round 1 ──host:next-round──► round 2 ──► ...
```

`GameState.currentRoundIndex` tracks which of `board.rounds` is live. `gameManager.advanceRound` rejects the transition (via the `host:next-round` ack) if a question, Daily Double, or Final Jeopardy is currently active, or if the board is already on its last round — otherwise it increments the index and clears per-question/buzzer/lockout state, while leaving players, scores, stats, and `lastCorrectPlayerId` untouched. A round is "complete" (`boardStorage.isRoundComplete`) when every question id in `rounds[currentRoundIndex]` appears in `answeredQuestions` — this is what the host UI uses to highlight "Next Round" and what `host:close-question` uses for the auto-end check below.

### Phase / end-game

```
lobby ──host:start──► playing ──host:end-game (or auto-end)──► finished ──host:resume-game──► playing
                          │                                                                      
                          └───────────────────────host:end (Close Room, any phase)──► session deleted
```

`phase` starts at `lobby` and the current UI never calls `host:start` (kept for future use), so in practice a session is `playing` from creation until it's explicitly ended. `host:close-question` checks, after closing, whether the just-completed round was the board's *last* round and is now complete:

- **Not the last round** — nothing happens server-side; the client-side "round complete" state just enables the host's "Next Round" button.
- **Last round, board has Final Jeopardy** — nothing happens server-side either; the host panel prompts "Start Final Jeopardy" or "End Game" instead.
- **Last round, no Final Jeopardy configured** — the server calls `endGame` itself, setting `phase: 'finished'` and broadcasting the update; every client (host, board, each phone) switches to the shared `Leaderboard` the moment they receive it.

`endGame`/`resumeGame` (via `host:end-game`/`host:resume-game`) let the host do the same thing manually at any time, including mid-Final-Jeopardy (which also tears down the FJ secrets). This is distinct from `host:end`, which deletes the session outright ("Close Room" in the UI) and is irreversible.
