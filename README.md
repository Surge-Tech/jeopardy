# Jeopardy

A self-hosted, fully customizable Jeopardy game platform. Build your own boards, host game nights in person or online, and let players buzz in from their phones — no app install required.

---

## Features

- **Board Editor** — Create unlimited Jeopardy boards with up to 6 categories and 5 clues each. Supports text, images, and video clues.
- **Real-time Buzzer System** — Players connect on any device via a browser. First buzz wins, ties are impossible.
- **Daily Doubles with Wagering** — Mark any clue as a Daily Double. The host reveals it and the game automatically prompts the right player to wager on their phone (with a host override, and a manual picker for the rare case no player has answered correctly yet) — scoring then uses their wager instead of the clue's face value.
- **Final Jeopardy** — A full wager-clue-reveal round with live wagers, a synced countdown timer, ambient music during the countdown, a dramatic per-contestant reveal, and a final scoreboard with a podium and stats.
- **Projection View** — A fullscreen board view designed for a TV or shared screen.
- **Host Control Panel** — Score tracking, manual score adjustments, game history log, per-player stats, and roll-back support.
- **Sound Effects** — Synthesized audio cues for buzz-ins, Daily Doubles, Final Jeopardy, and more, played on the board/TV so the room hears them. No audio files needed.
- **Persistent Storage** — Boards are saved as JSON files on disk. No database required.
- **Works Everywhere** — Run it on your laptop for an in-person game night, or deploy it to the cloud for a remote game night. Players connect from anywhere with a link.

```

The host runs the game from the Host Panel. The board display goes on the main screen (TV/projector). Players connect to the Buzzer page from their phones — no account, no install, just a URL and a name.
